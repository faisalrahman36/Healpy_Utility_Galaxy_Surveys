# Healpy_Utility_Galaxy_Surveys

This repo contains some utility code to help with healpy based galaxy survey analysis.

The files have code for:

1-Function to convert right ascensions given in hour,minutes and seconds format into degrees.
2-Function to convert declination given in degrees,arcminutes and arcseconds format into degrees only format.
3-Function (pix2ang_radec) to do the reverse of ang2pix_radec.
4-Function to perform pixf2ang operation but returns values in theta and phi format not in ra and dec format.
5-Function to give counts of galaxies on each healpix pixel. 
6-Function to create density fluctuation maps with mask.
7-Function to convert Cls to CCF_theta or ACF_theta.
8-Function to calculate error bars on CCF_theta or ACF_theta.
9-Function to calculate shot noise from average source count and nside values.
10-Function to calculate fsky ratio using the survey mask. Survey mask should have value=0 for masked pixels and value=1 for valid survey pixels.
